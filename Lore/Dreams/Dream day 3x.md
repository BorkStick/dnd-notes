walking through thick fog  
we enterr clearing and are blinded by the light  
we see people we recgonize but dont know  
look at the center of clearing and hear eating  
see a black tree with skellies hanging from it kids  
small round black lights illuminate the skulls  
red glow  
sky is dark black  
elvish figure lying under the tree pregos  
triplets  
she eating a fruit  
lights are dark red apples  
she eating them fruits  
tree gives her more fruit from the kidd skull  
eating stops  
she screames haunting us  
bright light comes from her belly  
its pitch black now  
we lying down  
we get up and are in a stone room  
we see odly shaped windows  
they spell out words  
they spell out  
THE NIGHT
