# Animal Legend


The animal legend

Long ago, the god [[Ubtao]] hardened his heart and vowed to weep for the people of [[Omu]] no longer. The rains stopped, the jungle withered and died, and death swept through [[Omu]].

One morning, a wise [[Zorbo]] emerged from her hollow tree and spoke to the dying Omuans. To convince [[Ubtao]] of their worth, she decided to cook him a stew made from all their good qualities. Catching such virtues wouldn’t be easy, so she asked a wily [[Almiraj]] to help her. The [[Almiraj]] snuck recklessness in the pot, which she saw as a virtue, and [[Ubtao]] spat out the stew when he tasted it. From that day on, [[Obo’laka the zorbo]] and[[ I’jin the almiraj]] became terrible enemies.

At noon, a brave [[Kamadan]] hopped down from her rock. She saw the evil in the Omuans’ hearts and decided to lance it like a troublesome boil. The [[Kamadan]] fashioned a holy spear, but she left it by the riverbank and a crafty grung stole it. In her rage, [[Shagambi the kamadan]] forgot all about the Omuans and chased [[Nangnang the grung]] forever across the sky.

When evening came, a wily [[Eblis]] stepped from his reed hut. He didn’t like the Omuans, but without them he’d have no one to play his tricks on. The [[Eblis]] sent a marsh frog to reason with [[Ubtao]], but the frog was angry and decided to wrestle the god instead. This amused [[Ubtao]], so he gave the frog tentacles to make it stronger. When [[Kubazan the froghemoth]] returned to [[Papazotl the eblis]], he chased [[Papazotl]] into the swamp with his new tentacles.

That night, a [[Su-monster]] broke into Ubtao’s palace and stole a pail of water for the Omuans. When the god came running to find it, the[[ Su-monster]] hid the pail in a jaculi’s burrow. [[Ubtao]] asked the jungle animals where his water was hidden, and [[Moa the jaculi]] was too honest to lie. When [[Wongo the su-monster]] found out how [[Moa]] had betrayed him, he vowed to catch the [[Jaculi]] and eat him up.

All the while, [[Unkh the flail snail]] lived deep under the earth. The noise of the other animals fighting made her slither up to the surface, and when day dawned over her shell, the light blinded [[Ubtao]] and made his eyes water. Life returned to [[Omu]], and the people built shrines to honor the animals who’d saved them.
