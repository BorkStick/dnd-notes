  walking through thick fog 
  we enterr clearing and are blinded by the light 
  we see people we recgonize but dont know 
  look at the center of clearing and hear eating
  see a black tree with skellies hanging from it kids
  small round black lights illuminate the skulls 
  red glow 
  sky is dark black
  elvish figure lying under the tree pregos
  triplets 
  she eating a fruit 
  lights are dark red apples 
  she eating them fruits 
  tree gives her more fruit from the kidd skull
  eating stops 
  she screames haunting us
  bright light comes from her belly
  its pitch black now 
  we lying down 
  we get up and are in a stone room 
  we see odly shaped windows 
  they spell out words
  they spell out 
  THE NIGHT


Stecve looses 2  health permantly 
we wake up
